# Simple Version Control System (VCS) in Python

This project implements a simple version control system (VCS) in Python. The VCS provides basic functionalities for initializing a repository, adding files, committing changes, and viewing commit history.

## Features

- **Repository Initialization**: Initialize a new VCS repository at a specified path.
- **Adding Files**: Add files to the repository by copying them into the repository directory.
- **Committing Changes**: Commit changes to the repository by creating a commit object containing the commit message, timestamp, and list of files.
- **Viewing Commit History**: Display the commit history, showing details of each commit.

## Getting Started

To use the version control system, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Alan69/version_control_system.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd version_control_system
    ```

3. Run the VCS system using Python:

    ```
    python vcs.py
    ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform version control operations like repository initialization, adding files, committing changes, and viewing commit history.

## Usage

- **Initializing a Repository**: Use the `initialize` method to initialize a new VCS repository at a specified path.
- **Adding Files**: Use the `add` method to add files to the repository by copying them into the repository directory.
- **Committing Changes**: Use the `commit` method to commit changes to the repository by creating a commit object containing the commit message, timestamp, and list of files.
- **Viewing Commit History**: Use the `history` method to display the commit history, showing details of each commit.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
